                    Team should contain 2-3 members <br><br>
                    Ironclad sleuths, assemble! Step boldly into the treacherous world of Westeros, where danger and
                    secrets lurk in every shadow. In this realm, power is fleeting, deception is constant, and betrayal
                    is always just one step away. Only the sharpest minds will survive the deadly game that unfolds
                    here. Steel and courage won’t be enough you’ll need cunning, wit, and an eye for detail to navigate
                    the webs of lies and intrigue.

                    In this land, alliances shift like the sands, and trust is a luxury few can afford. Beneath the
                    surface, plots thicken and danger brews. Anyone could be the enemy, and no one is above suspicion.
                    Can you, with your team of fellow sleuths, unravel the hidden threads of conspiracy before time runs
                    out? Will you be the one to expose the truth, or will the mystery remain buried, along with the
                    fallen?

                    The fate of the Seven Kingdoms rests on your ability to outsmart your rivals and piece together the
                    clues. This is not just a mystery it’s a battle of minds in a land where survival comes at a price.
                    There are no second chances here, only victors who rise to power and those who fall to their demise.
                    Winter has arrived, and with it, a deadly challenge awaits.

                    The question remains will you be the one to uncover the truth before it’s too late, or will the
                    mysteries of Westeros consume you? Winter is here, and so is the mystery. Let the game begin!
