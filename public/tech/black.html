                    This event tests participants' proficiency in designing circuits and
                    projects using Arduino in Tinkercad. Each team will be given a real-world
                    problem, and they must design an efficient project using various sensors
                    and components in the Arduino environment. From wiring circuits to writing
                    code, teams will need to ensure their project works flawlessly and meets
                    the specified application requirements. The first team to complete their
                    project with accurate functionality and output will be declared the winner.
                    This is your chance to demonstrate innovation and practical problem-solving
                    using Arduino technology! <br><br>

                    <b>ROUND 1</b><br>

                    1. Each team should contain 2-3 members. <br>

                    2. Join us for an exciting event where participants will embark on a lyrical tech- themed treasure
                    hunt. <br><br>

                    <b>ROUND 2</b><br>

                    1. Each team should be capable of analyzing and solving real-time problems efficiently. <br>
                    2. Teams are required to simulate their circuit designs for validation. <br>
                    3. The first team to successfully design and present the solution will be declared as the winner. <br>
