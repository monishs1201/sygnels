                    Deal Dash is an electrifying event that combines circuit-building skills
                    with strategy and negotiation. Teams are provided with incomplete circuit
                    kits, and to complete their circuit, they must acquire missing components
                    from other teams. However, it's not that easyâ€”teams must challenge each
                    other with technical questions, and only if they successfully answer can
                    they obtain the needed component. Strategic deals and quick thinking will
                    play a major role. The first team to successfully build and demonstrate a
                    working circuit wins. It's a race of brains, wit, and speed!

                    <br><br>

                    <b>ROUND 1</b><br>

                    1. Each team should contain 2-3 members. <br>

                    2. A thrilling rapid-fire round where participants will be challenged and evaluated through an
                    exciting tech-themed memory game. <br><br>

                    <b>ROUND 2</b><br>

                    The teams will be given a circuit with a limited set of components. The teams will be negotiating
                    with the other teams for the other components. <br>

                    Trades hinge on quiz-style questions, where a correct answer blocks the exchange and a wrong one
                    secures it. <br>

                    Each negotiation will be for 7-10 minutes. <br>

                    The first team to complete will be declared as the winner. <br>
