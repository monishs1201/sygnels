                    Digitrix is an event designed for those who love digital electronics.
                    It challenges participants with complex questions that test their knowledge
                    in digital logic design. The event includes tasks such as circuit design, debugging,
                    and analyzing logical operations. Participants will be required to troubleshoot digital
                    circuits and optimize them for performance. This competition is ideal for those looking
                    to showcase their skills in designing efficient, error-free digital systems. Be ready to
                    decode, debug, and conquer the circuits!

                    <b>ROUND 1</b><br>

                    1. Each team should contain 2-3 members. <br>

                    2. The participants will be evaluated on their core understanding and innovative concepts surrounding
                    digital circuits. <br><br>

                    <b>ROUND 2</b><br>

                    1. The participants will be provided with a real-time problem. <br>

                    2. They should analyse the question and must provide the k-map, truth table, Boolean expression and
                    logic circuit. <br>

                    3. The team which completes first will be considered as the winner. <br>

                    4. In case of a tie, a tie-breaking question will be given for the consideration of the winning
                    team. <br>
