                    Participants of the Line Following Robot Competition should build a fast line-following robot that
                    is able to follow lines from the starting line to the finishing line according to the competition
                    rules. The robot must move autonomously. <br><br>

                    <b>TEAM DETAILS</b><br><br>

                    3. Only two members are allowed on the track field to operate the robot. <br><br>

                    <b>ROBOT SPECIFICATION</b><br><br>

                    1. The robot must move autonomously and start with a push button. <br>
                    2. Any wireless/wired remote control is not allowed. <br>
                    3. The robot cannot split or separate into more than one unit. <br>
                    4. All robots must be designed and manufactured to cause no harm to any person and cause no damage to
                    the field. <br>
                    5. The robot will be inspected before every game. Robots that are not made in conformity with the rules
                    will not be allowed to participate. <br><br>

                    1. The robot must start behind the starting line and must move along the designated track until it
                    touches the finishing line. <br>
                    2. Each team will be given 2 tries to achieve their fastest time. The fastest time out of the two
                    tries
                    will be considered as the teamâ€™s final time. <br>
                    3. Team members will be given 1 minute to set up before the start of the game. <br>
                    4. After the 1-minute setup, the team is required to start their robot from the starting line at the
                    start of the timer. <br>

                    5. The timer will stop when the robot touches the finishing line. <br>
                    6. If the robot stops or deviates from the track, the participant will receive a 5-second time
                    penalty,
                    which will be added to the total time. <br>
